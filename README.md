# ws-servers

This repo demonstrates deployment of different WebSocket servers powered by
Node.js and Now. To learn how to run and deploy each, follow one of these links:

 * **[Âµws](./uws)**
 * **[ws](./ws)**
 * **[websocket](./websocket)**
 * **[nodejs-websocket](./nodejs-websocket)**

## wsbench

A simple `wsbench` program is also included to compare performance between
the servers.

The results show the total elapsed time of 1000 roundtrips by 100 simultaneous
clients against the WebSocket servers listed above, deployed on `now.sh`.
